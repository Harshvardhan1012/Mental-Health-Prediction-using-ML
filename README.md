**Machine Learning Algorithms:**

Employed four popular machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression,Random Forest and KNN.

**Features Used for Prediction:**

Model considers a variety of factors, including demographic information, workplace environment, and mental health symptoms and diagnoses.

**Performance Metrics:**

Evaluated model performance using multiple metrics:
Accuracy: Measure of overall correctness.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**Results:**

1)Logistic Regression
